# CSC 308 - Mobile Application Development for iOS - Spring 2020

This is the source code for my submission of the CSC 308 Assignment 5 individual project in Spring 2020 @ EKU.

Write a game for iPhone Xs:
1. The application should provide a button “Help” to trigger the display of an alert view to
tell the user how to play the game.
2. The application includes six buttons that are associated with random integers among 0,
100, 200, 300, 400, and 500 without repeat. The buttons should have background images.
The application allows the user to click any two of these buttons.
3. Every time a button is clicked, its associated number should be revealed and displayed on
the button, and the total number of dollars that the user has earned is displayed at the
bottom of the screen.
4. After the user has clicked two buttons, another alert view is displayed to report the result
of the game and allow the user to choose from playing again or exiting the game.
